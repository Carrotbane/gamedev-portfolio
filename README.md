## About Me

Hi there! 

My name is **Marcus Jansson**, a 22 years old Swedish game development student, and this is where I gather and summarise all of my projects!

I'm about to graduate from the University of Skövde in the summer of this year (2025), so I'm curiously looking for any work opportunities where I can utilize my skills and grow in the field of game development, or even IT in general!

I have a **deep passion for videogames**. My interest began from playing old flash games on my family's home PC when I was only 5 years old, and many consoles, laptops and PCs later, I'm now deeply fascinated by the hard work, skill and creativity that lies behind the many great games I have played in my life. 

To be part of a team that **pours their hearts into their games**, and to be there and play a vital role in the creation of those games, is the drive that makes me pursue a career in this field.
